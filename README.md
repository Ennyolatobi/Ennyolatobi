# About Me
I‚Äôm a learner on the **ALX Full-Stack Software Engineering** track. My motivation for software engineering is simple: **turn real-world problems into digital solutions that are easy and enjoyable to use**. I care deeply about accessibility and building software that has real impact.

**Short mission:** Build human-centered, accessible web apps that solve everyday problems and scale.

**What I love:** user-friendly UI, clean code, practical automation, and learning technologies that let me ship value quickly.

# Roadmap & Goals
**Short-term goals**
- Complete core front-end courses and projects (HTML, CSS, responsive design).
- Deepen JavaScript fundamentals and build interactive UI components.
- Start learning React (or an equivalent modern framework).

**Mid-term goals**
- Learn back-end fundamentals (Node.js, Express).
- Build and document simple REST APIs.
- Integrate front-end and back-end into full-stack projects.

**Long-term goals**
- Deliver polished portfolio-ready full-stack applications.
- Prepare for job applications, technical interviews, and developer collaboration workflows.

# Projects I Want to Build


- **Accessible E-commerce UI** ‚Äî responsive store front with keyboard navigation & ARIA.
- **Local Services Finder** ‚Äî map + filters to find affordable local services (e.g., health, tutors).
- **Micro-SaaS: Habit Tracker** ‚Äî auth, personal dashboards, simple API and analytics.
- **Community Health App** ‚Äî small full-stack app for tracking maternal health resources.
